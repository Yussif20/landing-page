-Landing page
This is a very simple landing page to practice on what I have learned so far about DOM and how to manipulate it in the professional front end development course on Udacity.

The page start with simple four sections and a navbar that can take you to the section you click on.
There is also a button that you can add more sections with it dynamically and of course it will also be added to the navbar.
You can know what section you are by the active class that will be on both a the link and the section itself that will give it a different style from the others.
At the end you will find a button that take you to the top of the page again.
